Vincent van Gogh - Post-Impressionism

A CS:S defusal map based on Vincent van Gogh's works of art.

This map was made by NIPPER back in late 2004. You can find it on GameBanana ( https://gamebanana.com/maps/9449 ) if you want to download it for CS:S. It includes a navigation mesh that can be used for NextBots, as well as a map icon.

"How rich art is; if one can only remember 
what one has seen, one is never without 
food for thought or truly lonely, never 
alone."
- Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh
